# Repository

The repository deisgn pattern is used in order to abstracft CRUD operations from the domain models. This means that CRUD oeprations are done using the methods defined within the various repositories as apposed to defining them within the domain or elsewhere in the application in order to minimize overlapping code and complexity.

## Sensor Repository
The Sensor repository defines the various CRUD operations on the Sensor domain model.

## SensorData Repository
The SensorData repository defines the various CRUD operations on the SensorData domain model.

## User Repository
The User repository defines the various CRUD operations on the User domain model.
