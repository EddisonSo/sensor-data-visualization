# Routes

API routes allow services and users to perform CRUD operations via REST protocol. The API exposes two paths:

## Sensor API URL
```
https://{api-service-url}/sensor_api/
```
The Sensor API URL contains all the paths that allow users to perform CRUD operations on the Sensor domain.

```
https://{api-service-url}/data_api/
```
The SensorData API URL contains all the paths that allow users to perform CRUD operations on the SensorData domain.
